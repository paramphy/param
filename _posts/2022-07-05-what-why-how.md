Oh no! I need to learn something new again. Oh yes! I will learn something new again.

No, I am not gonna preach anything but I face this dilemma every time I do something new. I may abandon the project as I don't yet comprehend why I am doing it. And sometimes my mind goes like 'What the hell life is f*#king random dude go get on it'. Mind is a tricky one to solve. So about the blog, I think I donâ€™t know what I want to do. Mhe so what may be I will stop doing it in the middle but I am gonna surely try.

This blog is going to be all about my thoughts so expect it to be mostly random. Sometimes I am gonna drop something heavy (that's what I like to say myself), maybe some science stuff, or, maybe nothing but some gibberish. I am not expecting anything meaningful out of it. Do everything needs to be meaningful at all?  So let me try this thing and look forward to posting every week or so.
