First of all let me dump some information, information is important.

> NASAâ€™s James Webb Space Telescope has produced the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date. Known as Webbâ€™s First Deep Field, this image of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is overflowing with detail.
>
> Thousands of galaxies â€“ including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared â€“ have appeared in Webbâ€™s view for the first time. This slice of the vast universe is approximately the size of a grain of sand held at armâ€™s length by someone on the ground.
>
> This deep field, taken by Webbâ€™s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), is a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totaling 12.5 hours â€“ achieving depths at infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescopeâ€™s deepest fields, which took weeks.

History has been created and I feel really excited about this. This may be a mere image of our universe as we have explored so far. The former statement is not mere at all, not at all. We can picture the universe now, not imagining it, a real image. I can remember a story befitting to this situation. Lord Krishna in the time of his infancy used to be a nuisance for his mother. One fine day his older brother (Sri Balaram) complained to his mother that little Krishna is eating soil outside. His mother rushed to the situation and tried to stop little Krishna. She scolded and demanded to show her what is inside his mouth. This story is going dull and common so far but things gonna get interesting now. When the little miracle boy opened his mouth she was in awe and witnessed the universe in his mouth. 

As I heard this fascinating story in my childhood I imagined something but there was a vague picture of the universe inside a little boy's mouth. That's not too bad as a child's imagination. As I grew up I fill this imagination with data. The vagueness is getting dissolved somehow. But today the reality, the real image of the observed universe just demolished the vagueness in a good way off course ðŸ˜‚. I really enjoyed my first imagination thankfully to our history and culture and I am privileged to witness the real image thanks to modern scientific achievements.
