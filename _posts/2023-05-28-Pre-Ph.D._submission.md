When I got to hear that I need to give a presentation the first response was just fear. After a certain amount of time my mind tends to justify that fear and it justified it well enough. I have always been afraid of stages, always afraid to face the faces staring at you. But I need to present somehow and I needed to give a good presentation. Why I was afraid of the audience thats a real mystery but may be the reason is that the things I was talking about was not my own. In this case I need to talk about the things I have done for last five years. Thats something different and for the first time. I am not giving a speech, I am just sharing my works and I love doing that. 
Surprisingly, the thing was fun. I thing I am going to love it in long run. Need to do more on the way need to learn more.

And yes, here is my presentation file if it helps anyone. 

<div class="links">

  {%- if page.presentation %}
    <a href="{{page.presentation}}" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">presentation file</a>
{%- endif %}
  {%- if page.pdf %}
    <a href="{{page.pdf}}" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">presentation pdf</a>
{%- endif %}
</div>
