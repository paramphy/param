	abstract = {We report here the synthesis and dielectric characteristics of lead-free methylammonium bismuth chloride (MABiCl) and bromine (Br) doped methylammonium bismuth chloride (MABiBrCl) powders. The dielectric characteristics of the samples (pressed powder pellet) measured in the frequency range 1 Hz to 1 MHz and temperature range 333–403 K indicate complex electrical transport in these halide perovskite materials. We have observed that the transport is dominated by longrange hopping of carriers and localized charges above and below a critical frequency respectively. The experimental data are fitted with the theoretical models considering grains, grain boundary, and contacts effects and made a comprehensive analysis. The activation energy obtained from ac electrical conductivity measurements is found to be relatively higher for the Br doped MABiBrCl than undoped MABiCl, which might explain some of the properties reported on solar cells and optoelectronic devices.},
