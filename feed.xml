After a certain amount of time my mind tends to justify that fear and it justified it well enough. I have always been afraid of stages, always afraid to face the faces staring at me. But I need to present somehow and I needed to give a good presentation. Why I was afraid of the audience thatâ€™s a real mystery but may be the reason is that the things I was talking about was not my own. In this case I need to talk about the things I have done for last five years. Thats something different and for the first time. I am not giving a speech, I am just sharing my works and I love doing that. Surprisingly, the thing was fun. I thing I am going to love it in long run.

Known as Webbâ€™s First Deep Field, this image of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 is overflowing with detail.</p> <p>Thousands of galaxies â€“ including the faintest objects ever observed in the infrared â€“ have appeared in Webbâ€™s view for the first time. This slice of the vast universe is approximately the size of a grain of sand held at armâ€™s length by someone on the ground.</p> <p>This deep field, taken by Webbâ€™s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), is a composite made from images at different wavelengths, totaling 12.5 hours â€“ achieving depths at infrared wavelengths beyond the Hubble Space Telescopeâ€™s deepest fields, which took weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Visit <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/038/01G7JGTH21B5GN9VCYAHBXKSD1">here</a> for more info.</p> <p>History has been created and I feel really excited about this. This may be a mere image of our universe as we have explored so far. The former statement is not mere at all, not at all. We can picture the universe now, not imagining it, a real image. I can remember a story befitting to this situation. Lord Krishna in the time of his infancy used to be a nuisance for his mother. One fine day his older brother (Sri Balaram) complained to his mother that little Krishna is eating soil outside. His mother rushed to the situation and tried to stop little Krishna. She scolded and demanded to show her what is inside his mouth. This story is going dull and common so far but things gonna get interesting now. When the little miracle boy opened his mouth she was in awe and witnessed the universe in his mouth.</p> <p>As I heard this fascinating story in my childhood I imagined something but there was a vague picture of the universe inside a little boyâ€™s mouth. Thatâ€™s not too bad as a childâ€™s imagination. As I grew up I fill this imagination with data. The vagueness is getting dissolved somehow. But today the reality, the real image of the observed universe just demolished the vagueness in a good way off course ðŸ˜‚. I really enjoyed my first imagination thankfully to our history and culture and I am privileged to witness the real image thanks to modern scientific achievements.</p> <p>For a High-definition image click <a href="https://webbtelescope.org/contents/media/images/2022/038/01G7JGTH21B5GN9VCYAHBXKSD1">here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="events"/><category term="universe"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image of our universe published by NASA]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What, why and how to do this?</title><link href="https://paramphy.github.io/param/blog/2022/what-why-how/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What, why and how to do this?"/><published>2022-07-04T17:18:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-04T17:18:00+00:00</updated><id>https://paramphy.github.io/param/blog/2022/what-why-how</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://paramphy.github.io/param/blog/2022/what-why-how/"><![CDATA[<blockquote> Oh no!

I may abandon the project as I donâ€™t yet comprehend why I am doing it. And sometimes my mind goes like â€˜What the hell life is f*#king random dude go get on itâ€™. Mind is a tricky one to solve. So about the blog, I think I donâ€™t know what I want to do. Mhe so what may be I will stop doing it in the middle but I am gonna surely try.</p> <p>This blog is going to be all about my thoughts so expect it to be mostly random. Sometimes I am gonna drop something heavy (thatâ€™s what I like to say myself), maybe some science stuff, or, maybe nothing but some gibberish. I am not expecting anything meaningful out of it. Do everything needs to be meaningful at all?
