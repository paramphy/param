I am **Paramesh Chandra**, doing my Ph.D. in Physics from [Visva-Bharati](https://visvabharati.ac.in/), Santiniektan, India. I am currently working on renewable energy field which is mostly focused on [perovskite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite) solar cells. Temporary goal of my work to increase the stability and efficiency of lead free [perovskite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite) solar cells. I like reading books, coding, having intriguing conversations. Currently coding in Python may learn something more I always do.
